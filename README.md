# Experimental Data README

## Overview
This repository contains experimental data from the project, including results of BPMN models generated through experiments and reference models. The structure of the folders aims to facilitate understanding and access to different sets of results and the underlying processes that were used during the experiments.

## Folder Structure

### 1. Root Folders
Each folder in the root directory contains a different set of **results of BPMN models** generated through the conducted experiments, along with a **reference model**. These models represent various workflows and were produced based on different methodologies and interview-derived specifications.

### 2. `Process` Folder
Inside the `Process` folder, you will find:

- **`DECS` Folder**: This folder contains the **declarative specification** obtained through interviews with stakeholders. The declarative specification served as the basis for generating the BPMN models. The documents here represent the initial requirements and constraints gathered, which were translated into formal process models during the experimental phase.

## Usage
Researchers and developers can use the data in this repository to:

1. **Analyze Generated BPMN Models**: Compare the generated models with the reference models to evaluate the differences and identify areas for improvement.
2. **Understand the Declarative Specification**: The `DECS` folder contains valuable context about the requirements used for generating the BPMN models, providing insights into the rationale behind the design.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have appropriate BPMN modeling tools to open and view the models provided in the folders.
- The reference models are included to provide a benchmark for evaluating the experimental results.
